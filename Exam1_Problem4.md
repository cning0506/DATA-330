# Problem 4  
## Find an example of a (weakly) stationary process and a non-stationary process (do not use the bat echolocation data from the notebook). Include screenshots (if possible) and references of these processes. In 150 words or less describe what it means for a process to be weakly stationary and why we care about it for our analysis of time series.

### Example of (Weakly) Stationary Process: Daily change in the Google stock price for 200 consecutive days
