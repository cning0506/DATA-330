|       | Sum of the Squares  | The sum of the squares is the summation of squares of variation, which variation is defined as the difference between the data and the arithmetic mean.   |
|       | Degree of Freedom   | Degrees of Freedom refers to the maximum number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the data sample. (Ganti, A. (2021, January 27). Degrees of freedom definition. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degrees-of-freedom.asp.) |
| 1.1   | Random Variable (Y)        | It is a function defined on a sample space Ω, whose range is the real numbers, IR |
|       | Real Numbers  (IR)         | A real number is any positive or negative number, including all integers and all rational and irrational numbers. (Real Number. Real Number Definition. https://techterms.com/definition/realnumber.)    |
|       | Observation                | An observation is a value of something of interest you're measuring or counting during a study or experiment. (Stephanie, G. (2020, June 8). Observation in Statistics: Simple Definition &amp; Examples. Statistics How To. https://www.statisticshowto.com/observation-in-statistics/#:~:text=An%20observation%20in%20statistics%20is,time%2C%20or%20number%20of%20animals.)     |
|       | Stochastic Process         | A  stochastic process is a collection of random variables {Y(ω);ω∈Ω} where all random variables are defined on the same sample space.|
|       | Time/time series           | A Time series is a series of data/values collected at successive times, usually with a equivalent interval between them.   |
|       | Discrete        |  Discrete data are specific values that are based on counts. For example: The number of patients in a hospital.     |
|       | Realization     | A realization of a time series is the set of values that result from the occurrence of some observed event.   |
|       | Ensemble        | Ensemble is the collection of all possible realizations.     |
|       | Expected value  |       |
|       | Ordinate        | Ordinate is another name for vertical axis.   |
|       | Abscissa        | Abscissa is another name for horizontal axis. |
|       | Covariance      |       |
