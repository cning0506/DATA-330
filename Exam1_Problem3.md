|       | Sum of the Squares  | The sum of the squares is the summation of squares of variation, which variation is defined as the difference between the data and the arithmetic mean.   |

|       | Real Numbers  (IR)         | A real number is any positive or negative number, including all integers and all rational and irrational numbers. (Real Number. Real Number Definition. https://techterms.com/definition/realnumber.)    |
|       | Observation                | An observation is a value of something of interest you're measuring or counting during a study or experiment. (Glen, S. (2020, June 8). Observation in Statistics: Simple Definition &amp; Examples. Statistics How To. https://www.statisticshowto.com/observation-in-statistics/#:~:text=An%20observation%20in%20statistics%20is,time%2C%20or%20number%20of%20animals.)     |
|       | Stochastic Process         | A  stochastic process is a collection of random variables {Y(ω);ω∈Ω} where all random variables are defined on the same sample space.|
|       | Time/time series           | A Time series is a series of data/values collected at successive times, usually with a equivalent interval between them.   |
|       | Discrete        |  Discrete data are specific values that are based on counts. For example: The number of patients in a hospital.     |
|       | Realization     | A realization of a time series is the set of values that result from the occurrence of some observed event.   |
|       | Ensemble        | Ensemble is the collection of all possible realizations. |
|       | Expected value  | A predicted value of a variable, calculated by the sum of all possible values and multiplied by the probability of its occurence.   |
|       | Ordinate        | Ordinate is another name for vertical axis.   |
|       | Abscissa        | Abscissa is another name for horizontal axis. |
|       | Covariance      | Covariance is a measure of how much random variables vary together. (Glen, S. Covariance in Statistics: What is it? Example. Statistics How To. https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/covariance/.)       |
|       | Autocovariance  | The autocovariance is a function that gives the covariance of the process with itself at pairs of time points. (Wikimedia Foundation. (2020, September 18). Autocovariance. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,of%20the%20process%20in%20question.)|
|       | Autocorrelation | Autocorrelation refers to the degree of correlation between the values of the same variables across different observations in the data. (Autocorrelation. Statistics Solutions. (2020, June 22). https://www.statisticssolutions.com/autocorrelation/.)       |
| 1.2   | Stationarity    | Stationarity is also known as the state of "statsitcal equilibrium." The term describes the basic behavior of a stationary time series does not change in time.   |
|       | Ergodic (process)  | A time series where ensemble averages are consistent with those from a single realization are called ergodic processes.  |
|       | Strictly Stationary| For a time series to be strictly stationary, it has to fulfill the following: (1)for any  t1,t2∈T , the distributions of  X(t1 ) and  X(t2)  must also be the same; (2) all bivariate distributions  {X(t),X(t+h)}  must be the same for all values of  h. |
|       | Covariance Stationarity (Weak Stationarity)| A time series can be considered covariance stationary or has weak stationarity if the following are true: (1) E[X(t)]=μ  and is constant for all values of t; (2) Var[X(t)]=σ2<∞ (i.e., is finite for all t); (3) γ(t1,t2) depends only on t2−t1; (4) γ(h) is a semi-definite process (i.e., it's positive or zero for all scalar multiples) |
|       | Cauchy-Schwarz inequality | It can be expressed by the expression: |γ(h)|≤γ(0)  for all  h. It is used to prove that the inner product is a continuous function with respect to the topology induced by the inner product itself. (Wikimedia Foundation. (2021, February 7). Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality.)|
|       | Sample autocorrelation function | It is an estimator expressed as follow, ρ^h=γ^h/γ^0, where p(h) is the natural estimator. |
|       | Time Domain     | Time domain refers to the analysis of mathematical functions, physical signals or time series of economic or environmental data, with respect to time. (Wikimedia Foundation. (2019, May 9). Time domain. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain.)      |
|       | Frequency Domain| Frequency Domain refers to the analysis of mathematical functions or signals are conveyed in terms of frequency, rather than time. (DeepAI. (2019, November 1). Frequency Domain. DeepAI. https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/frequency-domain.)    |
|       | Aperiodic       | Aperiodic indicates irregular occurence or not oscillatory. (Merriam-Webster. Aperiodic. Merriam-Webster. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aperiodic.)   |
|       | Spectral Density| When we determine the frequency or cyclic content of data, the relevant information in the autocorrelation is more readily conveyed through the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation, called the spectral density, rather than through the autocorrelation itself.   |
|       | Periodigram     | We use the periodogram as an estimate of the spectral density of a signal. We also used it for identifying the dominant frequencies.  |
|       | AR1 | AR1 refers to First-Order Autorgressive regression. The order of an autoregression is the number of immediately preceding values in the series that are used to predict the value at the present time. (14.1 - Autoregressive Models: STAT 501. PennState: Statistics Online Courses. https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/14/14.1.)  |
